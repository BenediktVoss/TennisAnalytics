# 03 Ball Tracking

This directory contains scripts for modeling and comparing different approaches to ball tracking on the dataset.

---

## **Input Requirements**
To execute the scripts, ensure the following are available in the correct locations:
- **00_Dataset**: The dataset folder must contain the data in the correct format, which can be downloaded from the Kaggle dataset.

## **Files and Folders Overview**

### **1. `1_CV/`**
This folder contains scripts to train and evaluate a model using classic computer vision techniques for ball tracking.

### **2. `2_TrackNet/`**
This folder contains scripts to train and evaluate a deep learning, heatmap-based TrackNet model for ball tracking.

### **3. `3_YOLO/`**
This folder contains scripts to train and evaluate YOLO-based models for ball tracking.

### **4. `4_Analyze_Results.ipynb`**
This notebook:
- Analyzes and compares the results on the test set generated by the different approaches.

## **Output**
After running the scripts:
1. Trained models or scripts for each approach.
2. Results from each approach.
3. Comparative analysis of model performance.
